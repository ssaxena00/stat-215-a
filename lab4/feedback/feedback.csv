feature selection: would have been nice to try at least one method for feature selection, your visual inspection covers at most pairwise interactions.
 fit: you use two split methods which is a nice idea, but what is your overall fit assessment?
good classifier analysis: I don't see a section for q4, so I'm reading QDA section. I like the visualization with four colors, however you don't clearly state if this is image 3 where the model was trained on the other two images. It's important because there's a special pattern.
future data: would have been nice to say something more than would perform well. For example what kind of data may be good/ bad for this method and why.
