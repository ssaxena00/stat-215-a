45,10,"Finding 1 is straightforward, but not very interesting. Finding 2 is very interesting and reveals behavior of fog and clouds on two different days! Finding 3 is very interesting, revealing that the edge and interior may actually be measuring 2 different trees; backed up with both regression curves falling outside of each others' confidence intervals. Overall, patterns are interesting and fairly easy to follow.",9,"The EDA discusses the structure of the data, issues with it, and how it is cleaned. Also, they highlight some patterns between the climatic variables. Only slight critique is that some of these patterns seem like findings rather than general visualizations of how the data looks at a high level.",10,"They clearly demonstrate understanding of Figure 3 and 4 by explaining the big takeaways from the visuals. They also discuss some logical corrections to these visuals, which would make them easier to follow.",8,"The data is cleaned to only include readings with temperature between 5 - 35 C. This is a good reality check as it removes potentially erroneous measurements. However, it is not backed up statistically.",8,"The stability check is to include readings outside the voltage range 2.4 - 3V. Hjowever, we don't see a signficant difference, mainly because there are not many readings outside of this range. I think the stability check could be more robust, but it is useful in understanding the voltages of nodes.",Overall quality of report is high. They introduce the problems in the data and the paper and then give good explanation of their solutions.
