44,9,"First finding compares edge and interior readings of temperature and humidity; somewhat interesting. The second finding illustrates the relationship between incident PAR and direction; cool observation. The third finding is interesting, but is a little hard to follow. Overall, the findings reveal interesting patterns.",9,"The data exploration highlights important relationships about the data. Temperature vs Voltage and Humidity vs humidity_adj. Overall, they give a good picture of what the data looks like.",9,"They demonstrate a high-level understanding of the figures in the original report. They also describe the potential problems with the graphs, explaining how it is hard to follow sometimes. ",9,"The data cleaning is done rigorously. The reality check makes sure the data is consistent with real world knowledge, but there is no statistical proof.",8,The stability check compares a different time window than done in Finding 2. It could be more robust to confirm stability well.,"Overall, the report is very thorough and has good analysis/resuts."
